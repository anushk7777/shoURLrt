# User Interface Design Goals

Overall UX Vision: A minimalist, single-purpose, and trustworthy user interface. The user should immediately understand how to use the tool and feel confident in the safety of the links it produces.

Core Screens and Views:

Main Page: A single page application with an input field for the long URL, a "Shorten" button, and an area to display the result.

Stats Page: A simple, read-only page displaying the total click count for a given short link.

Branding: Clean, simple, and professional, with a color palette that emphasizes security and trust.

Accessibility: The design will be built to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, with future internationalization considered.
