# Goals and Background Context

Goals
Validate Demand: Achieve 1,000 unique short links created.

Validate Safety Value: Successfully block at least 100 known malicious links.

Ensure Usability: Maintain a median time-to-shorten of less than 3 seconds.

Ensure Reliability: Achieve greater than 99.5% API uptime.

Build Trust: See a user return rate of over 15% for creating a second link within 30 days.

Background Context
This project addresses a critical gap for content sharers who risk their reputation by unknowingly sharing malicious links. Existing tools lack the seamless, non-optional, real-time security verification that this product will offer as its core value. This PRD outlines the MVP for a "security-first" URL shortener, with a long-term vision to incorporate AI-driven analytics.

Requirements
Functional
FR1: The system must provide a public web interface for users to submit a long URL.

FR2: The system must validate that the submitted URL is in a syntactically valid format.

FR3: The system must query the Google Safe Browsing API with the submitted long URL to check for threats.

FR4: If the URL is flagged as unsafe, the system must reject the submission and display a clear warning to the user.

FR5: If the URL is confirmed safe, the system must generate a unique, short alphanumeric code.

FR6: The system must persistently store the mapping between the short code and the original long URL.

FR7: The system must return the full short URL to the user upon successful creation.

FR8: When a user accesses a short URL, the system must perform an HTTP redirect to the corresponding long URL.

FR9: The system must increment a click counter for each time a short URL is accessed.

FR10: The system must provide a public statistics page for each short link (e.g., short.url/code+/stats) that displays the total click count.

Non-Functional
NFR1: The median response time for the entire shorten-and-verify process must be under 3 seconds.

NFR2: The system's infrastructure must operate within the free tiers of its selected services (Vercel, Supabase, Google Cloud).

NFR3: The short code generation algorithm must guarantee uniqueness within the database.

NFR4: The API for link creation must be protected against abuse. This includes rate-limiting per IP address (e.g., 10 requests/minute).

NFR5: The overall service uptime must be greater than 99.5%.

NFR6: The system must gracefully handle edge cases such as redirect loops and malformed short codes.

(New) NFR7: The system must have operational monitoring and alerting for critical failures, such as external API outages or unusual traffic spikes.

(New) NFR8: The application must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards to be usable by people with disabilities.

(New) NFR9: All critical application errors and API requests must be logged in a structured format for production diagnostics.
