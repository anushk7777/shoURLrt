# Testing Strategy

Unit Tests: Will cover the short code generation logic and the Safe Browsing API client.

Integration Tests: Will test the POST /api/links endpoint to ensure it correctly interacts with the database and caching layer.

E2E Tests: A Playwright test will simulate the full user journey: submitting a valid URL, getting a short link, and verifying the redirect works.
