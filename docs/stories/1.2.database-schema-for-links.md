# Story 1.2: Database Schema for Links

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a database table to store link mappings,
**so that** shortened links can be persisted.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A links table is created in Supabase.
2. The table includes columns for short_code (primary key), long_url, and created_at.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create Database Schema (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Connect to Supabase project created in Story 1.1
  - [x] Create the links table with specified schema
  - [x] Add primary key constraint on short_code
  - [x] Add NOT NULL constraints on required fields
  - [x] Set up default values for created_at and click_count

- [x] Create Database Indexes (Performance)
  - [x] Create index on short_code for fast lookups
  - [x] Verify index performance with sample data

- [x] Database Migration Setup
  - [x] Create migration file for the schema
  - [x] Document rollback procedures
  - [x] Test migration in development environment

- [x] Validation and Testing
  - [x] Test table creation and constraints
  - [x] Verify data types and default values
  - [x] Test primary key uniqueness enforcement

## Dev Notes

[Source: docs/architecture/data-models-schema.md]

**Database Schema Requirements:**
The links table must be created with the following exact schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.links (
  short_code TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  long_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  click_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL
);

-- Index for fast lookups on the primary key
CREATE INDEX idx_links_short_code ON public.links(short_code);
```

**Key Technical Details:**

- Primary Key: short_code (TEXT) - unique identifier for each shortened link
- long_url (TEXT, NOT NULL) - the original URL to redirect to
- click_count (BIGINT, DEFAULT 0, NOT NULL) - tracks number of times link was accessed
- created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ, DEFAULT now(), NOT NULL) - timestamp of link creation
- Index: idx_links_short_code for optimized lookups

**Database Platform:**

- Using Supabase (PostgreSQL ~15.x) as specified in the tech stack
- Leverage Supabase's built-in migration tools
- Ensure UTC timezone for all timestamps

### Testing

Testing Requirements:

- Verify table creation succeeds
- Test all constraints (PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL)
- Validate default values are applied correctly
- Confirm index creation and performance
- Test basic CRUD operations on the table
