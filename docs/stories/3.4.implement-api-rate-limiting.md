# Story 3.4: Implement API Rate Limiting

## Status

Pending

## Story

As a platform owner, I want to protect the link creation API from abuse, so that the service remains stable for all users.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A rate limit is applied to the `POST /api/v1/links` endpoint.
- The limit is configured per IP address (e.g., 10 requests per minute).
- Requests exceeding the limit receive an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests response.

## Tasks/Subtasks

1.  **Choose Rate Limiting Strategy**: Select an appropriate rate limiting mechanism (e.g., fixed window, sliding window, token bucket).
2.  **Implement Rate Limiter**: Integrate the chosen rate limiting solution into the `POST /api/v1/links` endpoint.
3.  **IP Address Identification**: Accurately identify the client's IP address for rate limiting purposes.
4.  **Configuration**: Make the rate limit parameters (e.g., requests per minute) configurable.
5.  **Error Response**: Ensure that requests exceeding the limit return an HTTP 429 status code with an appropriate message.
6.  **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests to verify the rate limiting functionality.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Details

- **Endpoint**: The `POST /api/v1/links` endpoint is the target for rate limiting.
- **Mechanism**: Consider using middleware or a dedicated library for rate limiting (e.g., `express-rate-limit` for Node.js/Express, or a similar solution for other frameworks).
- **IP Identification**: Be aware of proxy servers and load balancers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For` header) when identifying the client IP.
- **Storage**: Rate limiting state might need to be stored in a fast, persistent store like Redis for distributed environments.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Granularity**: Rate limit per IP address is the primary requirement, but consider if per-user or per-API-key limiting might be needed in the future.
- **User Experience**: Provide clear feedback to users who hit the rate limit, possibly with `Retry-After` headers.
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring to track rate limit breaches and overall API usage.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Test the rate limiting logic in isolation, ensuring correct counting and blocking.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Send multiple requests from the same IP address to the `POST /api/v1/links` endpoint and verify that requests exceeding the limit are blocked with a 429 response.
  - Test with different IP addresses to ensure independent rate limits.
  - Verify the `Retry-After` header (if implemented) is correct.
- **Performance Testing**: Assess the overhead introduced by the rate limiting mechanism.
