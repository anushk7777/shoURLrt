# Story 1.3: Short Code Generation Service

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a service that generates a unique short code,
**so that** each link has a unique identifier.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A service is created that generates a short (e.g., 6-8 character) alphanumeric string.
2. The service checks the database to ensure the generated code is not already in use.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create Short Code Generation Algorithm (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Implement random alphanumeric string generator (6-8 characters)
  - [ ] Use secure random number generation
  - [ ] Define character set (letters and numbers, case-sensitive)
  - [ ] Create configurable length parameter

- [ ] Implement Uniqueness Validation (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create database lookup function to check existing codes
  - [ ] Implement retry logic for collision handling
  - [ ] Add maximum retry attempts to prevent infinite loops
  - [ ] Log collision events for monitoring

- [ ] Service Architecture
  - [ ] Create dedicated service class/module for code generation
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging
  - [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
  - [ ] Design for testability and modularity

- [ ] Performance Optimization
  - [ ] Optimize database query for existence check
  - [ ] Consider caching strategies for high-frequency generation
  - [ ] Implement efficient collision resolution

- [ ] Unit Testing
  - [ ] Test code generation with various lengths
  - [ ] Test uniqueness validation logic
  - [ ] Test collision handling and retry mechanism
  - [ ] Test error scenarios and edge cases

## Dev Notes

[Source: docs/architecture/data-models-schema.md]

**Technical Requirements:**

- Generate alphanumeric codes (6-8 characters recommended)
- Must check against existing short_code values in the links table
- Primary key field: short_code (TEXT)
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL

**Implementation Guidelines:**

- Use cryptographically secure random generation
- Character set: [A-Za-z0-9] (62 possible characters)
- With 6 characters: 62^6 = ~56 billion combinations
- With 8 characters: 62^8 = ~218 trillion combinations
- Collision probability is extremely low but must be handled

**Service Design Patterns:**

- Follow Next.js service layer patterns
- Implement as reusable utility function
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow error handling best practices

**Database Integration:**

- Use Supabase client for database queries
- Implement efficient SELECT query: `SELECT 1 FROM links WHERE short_code = ?`
- Handle database connection errors gracefully

### Testing

Testing Requirements:

- Unit tests for generation algorithm
- Integration tests with database
- Performance tests for collision handling
- Edge case testing (empty database, high collision scenarios)
- Mock database responses for isolated testing
