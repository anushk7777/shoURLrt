# Story 3.2: Increment Click Count on Redirect

## Status

Pending

## Story

As a developer, I want the click counter to be incremented every time a link is accessed, so that tracking is accurate.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The redirection service is updated to perform an atomic increment of the `click_count` for the corresponding short code.
- The increment operation is performed asynchronously to avoid delaying the redirect.

## Tasks/Subtasks

1.  **Modify Redirection Service**: Update the existing redirection service to include logic for incrementing the click count.
2.  **Atomic Increment Implementation**: Implement a database operation that atomically increments the `click_count` column for the given short code.
3.  **Asynchronous Processing**: Ensure the increment operation does not block the HTTP redirect response, potentially using a background task or a non-blocking database call.
4.  **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for database operations related to click count increment.
5.  **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for the click increment logic.
6.  **Integration Testing**: Test the entire redirection flow to ensure the click count is incremented correctly without affecting redirect performance.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Details

- **Redirection Service**: The existing service handling `/{short_code}` requests.
- **Database Operation**: Use a database-specific atomic increment function (e.g., `UPDATE links SET click_count = click_count + 1 WHERE short_code = $1`).
- **Asynchronous Approach**: Consider using a message queue (e.g., Redis, Kafka) or a serverless function to handle the increment asynchronously after the redirect has been initiated. Alternatively, a non-blocking database driver could be used if available and suitable.
- **Performance**: The primary goal is to not introduce latency to the user's redirection experience.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Concurrency**: Ensure that concurrent requests to the same short code do not lead to lost updates in the click count (hence, atomic increment).
- **Scalability**: The asynchronous approach should be scalable to handle a high volume of redirects.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test the atomic increment function in isolation.
  - Test error handling for database failures during increment.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Verify that visiting a short link increments its `click_count`.
  - Ensure the redirect still occurs quickly even with the increment logic.
  - Test with multiple concurrent requests to the same short link to confirm atomic increment.
- **Performance Testing**: Measure the latency of the redirection service before and after implementing the click count increment to ensure no significant degradation.
