Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a configured monorepo with CI/CD,
**so that** I have a stable foundation for development.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A Next.js project is initialized in a monorepo with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
2. A Supabase project is created.
3. A CI/CD pipeline is set up to deploy to Vercel on pushes to main.

  - [x] Create new Next.js project with TypeScript support
  - [x] Add Tailwind CSS configuration
  - [x] Configure project structure according to monorepo standards
  - [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality

- [x] Set up Supabase Integration (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create new Supabase project
  - [x] Save Supabase project credentials securely
  - [x] Add Supabase client configuration to the project

- [x] Configure CI/CD Pipeline (AC: 3)
  - [x] Connect repository to Vercel
  - [x] Configure environment variables in Vercel
  - [x] Set up automatic deployments for main branch
  - [x] Add build and test scripts to package.json

- [x] Project Documentation
  - [x] Update README with setup instructions
  - [x] Document environment variables required
  - [x] Add contribution guidelines

## Dev Notes

[Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

Technology Stack Requirements:

- Frontend Framework: Next.js ~14.1.0
- Language: TypeScript ~5.3.3
- Styling: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.1
- Database: Supabase (Postgres) ~15.x
- CI/CD & Hosting: Vercel
- Testing: Jest, Playwright ~29.x

Architecture Overview:

- The system is designed as a serverless web application built as a monorepo using Next.js
- Hosting will be on Vercel, utilizing its global edge network for the frontend and serverless functions for the backend API
- Data persistence will be handled by PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase
- The "Vercel + Supabase" stack is chosen for its generous free tiers

### Testing

Testing Requirements:

- Set up Jest for unit testing
- Configure Playwright for E2E testing
- Ensure test scripts are added to package.json
- Tests should be runnable in CI/CD pipeline

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of project initialization with comprehensive setup. The codebase demonstrates good architectural decisions, proper TypeScript usage, and well-structured components. The Next.js 15 compatibility updates show attention to framework evolution. Code is clean, readable, and follows modern React patterns.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary. The code is already well-structured and follows best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier properly configured
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows Next.js App Router conventions
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Next.js project with TypeScript properly initialized
- [x] Tailwind CSS configured and working
- [x] Supabase client properly configured with environment validation
- [x] Comprehensive test suite (unit + E2E) implemented
- [x] CI/CD pipeline configured via Vercel
- [x] Documentation complete with setup instructions
- [x] Environment variables properly templated
- [x] Next.js 15 async params compatibility implemented
- [ ] Consider adding input validation for URL format in frontend
- [ ] Consider adding database schema migration files
- [ ] Consider adding error boundary for better error handling

### Security Review

✓ **PASS** - Environment variables properly secured, Supabase client configured with public keys only, no sensitive data exposed in client-side code. Input sanitization handled by Supabase client.

### Performance Considerations

✓ **PASS** - Efficient React patterns used, proper state management, minimal bundle size with Next.js optimization. Database queries are simple and efficient.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review. The implementation is already of high quality.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-initialization.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done - All acceptance criteria met, comprehensive test coverage, excellent code quality, and proper documentation.
